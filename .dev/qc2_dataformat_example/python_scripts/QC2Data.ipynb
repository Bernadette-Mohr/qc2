    "This file is in hdf5 format allowing for easy import and export of the data from/to other formats. \n",
    "The structure is given by the data schema contained in the file `QC2schema.txt`. This file is processed by a number of Python scripts and then defines the hdf5 directory structure. We will illustrate the extraction of data into Python by means of the included `scf_hf.h5` file that was generated by the DIRAC program and serves there as an example for assessing DIRAC-generated data. The python scripts that process the schema are identical to the ones used in DIRAC and should be kept in sync as much as possible. The DIRAC schema itself is necessarily different as more information is stored and is given in the file `DIRAC23schema.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies for this notebook are:\n",
    "- process_schema.py: a collection of python functions to process the schema and read/write hdf5 files.\n",
    "- scf_hf.h5 : the above-mentioned sample data set from DIRAC, resulting from a calculation on the HF molecule.\n",
    "- QC2schema.txt and DIRAC23schema.txt: the definitions of the data schema's\n",
    "\n",
    "Please copy these file into the directory in which you start this Jupyter Notebook before running the next code cell and make sure that you have also installed the h5py library (`conda install h5py` if you are using the conda package manager) in your python environment."
