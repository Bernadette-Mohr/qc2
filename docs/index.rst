==========================================================


About qc2
=========

qc2 is a modular software designed to seamlessly integrate traditional computational chemistry codes
and quantum computing frameworks. It is specifically crafted for hybrid classical-quantum workflows
and relies on custom `ASE calculators <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_ as well as formatted data files
(*e.g.*, `QCSchema <https://molssi.org/software/qcschema-2/>`_) to efficiently offload 1- and 2-electron
integrals needed by various Python quantum computing libraries.

The qc2 software is a direct outcome of the `QCforQC project <https://research-software-directory.org/projects/qcforqc>`_,
a collaboration between `Netherlands eScience Center <https://www.esciencecenter.nl/>`_,
`Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) <https://vu.nl/nl>`_ and `SURF <https://www.surf.nl/>`_.


The QCforQC team
================

The QCforQC collaboration is currently composed by the following
members:

* Nicolas Renaud - Netherlands eScience Center
* Carlos M. R. Rocha - Netherlands eScience Center
* Luuk Visscher - Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
* Ariana Torres - SURF
